## Overview

<a href="https://placeholder.link">Paragon NTFS</a> approaches NTFS file system driver and disk access utility with an emphasis on structure and legibility. Views are organized into logical groups that guide you from overview states into detailed controls without confusion. Navigation is kept consistent across different modes, so you can shift contexts without re-learning how to move through the app.

The application leans on standard <a href="https://placeholder.link">macOS interaction models</a>, such as sheets, split views and inspectors.

Features are introduced carefully so existing projects and habits continue functioning as expected.
